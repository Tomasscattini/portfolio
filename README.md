## Bio

I recently graduated from an intensive bootcamp where I improved my developer skills and reinforced my social network.
I love to put my creativity to test and that's why I deeply enjoy creating new products for the web.
I have worked as a Music teacher in my home country for five years until my urge of adventure made me decide to hit the road and travel around the world.
That experience made me discover a whole new universe and expanded my perception of life.
Today I decide to make a positive change in the world wherever I can, and that is mostly through this powerful tool that is the internet.
